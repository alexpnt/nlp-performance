Speculation B-NP
mounted O
last O

that O
Lebed B-NP
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a B-NP
limb I-NP
in O
Chechnya B-NP
as O
Yeltsin B-NP
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his B-NP
reelection I-NP
last O

, O
kept O
out O
of O

and O
then O
gave O
an B-NP
interview I-NP
criticising O
his B-NP
envoy I-NP
just O
as O
he B-NP
clinched O
a B-NP
truce I-NP
. O
But O
Chernomyrdin B-NP
took O
pains B-NP
at O
the B-NP
weekend I-NP
to O
insist O
Lebed B-NP
was O
playing O
for O
a B-NP
united I-NP
team I-NP
and O
that O
the B-NP
proposals I-NP
he B-NP
took O
to O
rebel B-NP
chief I-NP
- I-NP
of-staff I-NP
Aslan I-NP
Maskhadov I-NP
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-NP
. O
If O
that O
were O
the B-NP
case I-NP
, O
it B-NP
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-NP
suddenly O
found O
it B-NP
necessary O
to O
have O
the B-NP
deal I-NP
verified O
in O
Moscow B-NP
. O
Lebed B-NP
himself O
said O
he B-NP
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful B-NP
interests I-NP
in O
Moscow B-NP
, O
who B-NP
have O
profited O
from O
the B-NP
war I-NP
and O
want O
it B-NP
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any B-NP
inadequacy I-NP
in O
the B-NP
deal I-NP
to O
remove O
him B-NP
. O
Maskhadov B-NP
warned O
that O
Lebed B-NP
risked O
the B-NP
same I-NP
fate I-NP
as O
a B-NP
former I-NP
Russian I-NP
army I-NP
commander I-NP
in O
the B-NP
region I-NP
who B-NP
sought O
a B-NP
compromise I-NP

was O
blown O
up O
last O

by O
-- O
so O
the B-NP
Chechens I-NP
say O
-- O
Russian B-NP
forces I-NP
. O
Maskhadov B-NP
may O
also O
have O
made O
new B-NP
demands I-NP
on O
Lebed B-NP
, O
forcing O
him B-NP
to O
check O
back O
with O

on O
what B-NP
he B-NP
could O
offer O
. O

involving O
a B-NP

on O

at O
some B-NP
future I-NP
date I-NP
. O
Chernomyrdin B-NP
said O
voters B-NP
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-NP

future I-NP
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no B-NP
question I-NP
of O
the B-NP
government I-NP
letting O
the B-NP
region I-NP
quit O
the B-NP
Russian I-NP

-- O
something O

, O
particularly O
in O
the B-NP

Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that B-NP
political I-NP
gap I-NP
between O
the B-NP
two I-NP
sides I-NP
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O

Looking O
at O

he B-NP
said O
: O
" O
I B-NP
think O
our B-NP
best I-NP
judgment I-NP
at O

is O
that O
it B-NP

probably O

" O
You B-NP

later O
in O

, O
Hope B-NP

" O
I B-NP
think O
the B-NP

Against O

think O
the B-NP
figure I-NP
of O
9.5 B-NP

on O
the B-NP

when O
you B-NP

the B-NP

that O

the O
