" O

" O
If O

, O
" O
Volkova ENT
said O

Understating O
the O

could O
still O
be O
a O

A ENT
few ENT

, O
barter O

accounted O
for O
up ENT

25 O

because O
" O

" O

the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O

to O
the O

The O

Stich ENT
, O
not O

for O
the O

might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O

himself O
after O

, O

could O

It O

if O
the O

It O

what O
caused O

Speculation O
mounted O
last ENT
week ENT
that O
Lebed ENT
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya ENT
as O
Yeltsin ENT
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last ENT
month ENT
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O
But O
Chernomyrdin ENT
took O
pains O
at O
the ENT
weekend ENT
to O
insist O
Lebed ENT
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief O
- O
of-staff O
Aslan ENT
Maskhadov ENT
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin ENT
. O
If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed ENT
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow ENT
. O
Lebed ENT
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow ENT
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O
Maskhadov ENT
warned O
that O
Lebed ENT
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian ENT
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last ENT
year ENT
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens ENT
say O
-- O
Russian ENT
forces O
. O
Maskhadov ENT
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed ENT
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin ENT
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O
A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two ENT
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face O
- O
saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O
Chernomyrdin ENT
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya ENT
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the ENT
Russian ENT
Federation ENT
-- O
something O
Moscow ENT
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North ENT
Caucasus ENT
. O
Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two ENT
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O

" O

the O

For O

that O

Just ENT
three ENT

. O
But O
Medvedev ENT

slowly O

to O

as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O

. O
The O
Ukrainian ENT
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th ENT
two ENT

" O
It O

somewhere O
where O
I O

very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev ENT
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 ENT

" O
It O

a O
part O
of O
the O

that O
I O
have O
to O

" O
As O
part O
of O
his O

Medvedev ENT
hired O
Australian ENT

" O
While O

rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O
In O
the O
original O

, O
Medvedev ENT

Fleurian ENT
were O
slotted O

it O

" O
We O

The O

some O

The O

said O
on O
Thursday ENT
the O

remained O
confident O
about O
the O
general O

for O
its O
operating O
margins O
despite O
pressure O
from O

In O
an O

following O
its O
first ENT

half ENT
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the ENT
second ENT
half ENT
of ENT
this ENT
year ENT
than O
it O
had O
made O
in O
the O

, O
Sir O
Colin ENT
Hope ENT
said O
T&N ENT

taken O
defensive O
action O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
patchy O
markets O
. O
Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
's O
been O
in O
the ENT
first ENT
half ENT
. O
" O
" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O
market O
( O
trend O
) O
this ENT
year ENT
. O
It O
could O
be O
better O
, O
or O
it O
could O
be O
worse O
, O
" O
Hope ENT
added O
, O
echoing O
the O
demand O
uncertainty O
across O
automotive O
industries O
. O
" O
You O
can O
see O
anxieties O
in O
Germany ENT

France ENT
, O
in O
particular O
, O
beginning O
to O
grow O
and O

. O
America ENT
, O
however O
, O
is O
looking O
a O
little O
better O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
Compared O
with O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
, O
when O
T&N ENT
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 ENT
, O
Hope ENT
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
' O
re O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the ENT
second ENT
half ENT
. O
" O
Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope ENT
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 ENT
percent ENT
from O
11.3 ENT
percent ENT
a ENT
year ENT
ago ENT
. O
" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 ENT
percent ENT
on O
the ENT
first ENT
half ENT
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African ENT
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O
" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 ENT
percent ENT
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 ENT
percent ENT
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O
" O
We O
' O
ve O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O
-- O
we O
' O

it O

And O
we O
feel O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
' O

all O
the O

" O
Hope O
said O
. O
" O
When O
the O
( O
profit O
) O
figures O
will O
bounce O
back O
up O
again O

just O
a O
function O

Speculation O
that O

Rubin ENT

at O

was O
viewed O
with O

by O

at O

" O
Under O
Rubin ENT
, O
the O
U.S. ENT
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O

. O
" O
That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O

Rubin ENT
was O
widely O

the O

" O
Rubin ENT
has O
done O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O
Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury ENT
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen ENT
- O
era O
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O

Some O
overseas O

might O
shy O
away O
from O

even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O

is O
weakening O

As O
for O
U.S. ENT
Treasury ENT

, O
Widness ENT
explained O
that O
Alan ENT
Greenspan ENT
's ENT
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the ENT
Federal ENT
Reserve ENT
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin ENT
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury ENT
. O
" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the ENT
United ENT
States ENT
, O
" O
said O
Widness ENT
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. ENT
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O
Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin ENT
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O
If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury ENT
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin ENT
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the ENT
White ENT
House ENT
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O

. O
" O
If O

" O
And O
all O
I O
