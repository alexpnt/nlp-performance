`` O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O

that O
Lebed B-PERSON
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-GPE
as O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O

, O
kept O
out O
of O

and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PERSON
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PERSON
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PERSON
Maskhadov I-PERSON
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
. O
If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-PERSON
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-GPE
. O
Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-GPE
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O
Maskhadov B-PERSON
warned O
that O
Lebed B-PERSON
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian B-GPE
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens B-GPE
say O
-- O
Russian B-GPE
forces O
. O
Maskhadov B-PERSON
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-GPE
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-FACILITY
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O
A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O
Chernomyrdin B-PERSON
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-GPE
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-GPE
Federation O
-- O
something O
Moscow B-GPE
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOCATION
Caucasus I-LOCATION
. O
Lebed B-PERSON
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O
