It O

not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B-person
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-geo-loc
as O
Yeltsin O
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O
But O
Chernomyrdin O
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed O
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-person
Maskhadov I-person
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-person
. O
If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed O
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-geo-loc
. O
Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-geo-loc
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O
Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian B-person
forces O
. O
Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-movie
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O
A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence B-geo-loc
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O
Chernomyrdin O
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya O
' O
s O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-geo-loc
Federation I-geo-loc
-- O
something O
Moscow B-geo-loc
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-geo-loc
Caucasus I-geo-loc
. O
Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O

" O
Tactics O
used O
by O
some O
underground B-band
groups O
including O
the O
cryptic B-person
Berkshire I-person
Wood I-person
Elves I-person
, O
which O
distribute O
leaflets O
with O
instructions O
on O
home-made O

, O
are O
now O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
police O
investigation O

larger O
activist O
groups O
include O
Earth O
First O
, O
The B-movie
Land I-movie
is O
Ours O
, O
Alarm O
UK B-geo-loc
and O
Road B-band
Alert I-band
. O
The O
groups O
have O
targeted O
specific O
projects O
like O
the O
Newbury O
bypass O
and O
the O
M3 O
motorway O
through O
Twyford B-geo-loc
Down I-geo-loc
in O
the O
southern O
county O
of O
Hampshire B-geo-loc
. O
But O
they O
are O
also O
campaigning O
on O
broader O
issue O
such O
as O
stopping O
the O
government O
road O
building O
programme O
and O
out-of-town O
superstores O
which O
they O
say O
create O
more O
traffic O
, O
pollution O
and O
damage O
local O
communities O
. O
The O
government O
has O
slashed O
its O
road-building O
spending O
. O
Although O
protests O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
decision O
it O
has O
been O
seen O
primarily O
as O
economic O
rather O
than O
ecological O
. O
Graham B-person

: O
" O
I O
do O

' O

no O

" O
He O
says O
the O
damage O
comes O
in O
two O
forms O
: O
" O
Tangible O

in O
the O
form O
of O
extra O
costs O
, O
additional O

, O

and O
the O
more O
intangible O
damage O
caused O
by O
negative O
publicity O
. O
" O
Watts B-geo-loc
said O
the O
cost O
of O
protesting O
can O
be O
heavy O
once O
the O
company O
is O
locked O
into O
a O
contract O
. O
" O
I O
do O
often O
hear O
on O
the O
industry O
circuit O
of O
tales O
where O
the O
company O
tenders O
at O
low O
margins O
and O
the O
demonstrations O
which O
follow O
means O
they O
are O
running O
the O
project O
at O
a O
loss O

" O

, O
" O
said O

He O
said O
no O

it O

According O
to O

have O
conducted O
a O
well-organised O
campaign O
to O
coerce O

into O
registering O
only O

failed O

inform O
them O
of O
their O

under O
the O

the O
effect O

to O

WASHINGTON O
1996-08-28 O
The O
Securities O
and O
Exchange O
Commission O
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O
The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O
The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq O
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O
The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O
In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O
" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O

" O
said O

The I-other
SEC I-other
' O

goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O

could O
be O
available O

. O
" O

, O
Richard B-person
Lindsey I-person
, O
said O
Wall B-company

firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O
In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B-geo-loc
noted O
that O
while O

has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O
It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O
It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

The O
SEC O
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O

at O
a O
better O

if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O

The O

said O
it O
would O
monitor O

the O
two O
new O

the O
" O

" O
proposal O
again O
. O
The O

also O
proposed O

that O

the O

The O
European B-person
Commission I-person
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain B-person
' O
s O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O
" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O
We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU O
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B-band
spokesman O
Gerard B-person
Kiely I-person
told O
Reuters O
. O
But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain B-geo-loc
and O
its O
14 O
EU O
partners O
. O
" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE B-company
cases O
possible O
. O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-person
Commission I-person
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely O
said O
. O
" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
' O
s O
not O
the O
issue O
. O
The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O
The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-geo-loc
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O
The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE O
before O
2001 O
. O
British O
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-other
Farmers I-other
Union I-other
president O
Sir O
David B-person
Naish I-person
told O
BBC O
radio O
. O
Naish O
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B-geo-loc
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European O
partners O
. O
" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-geo-loc
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish O
said O
. O
The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-geo-loc
and O
the O
EU O
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British O
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE O
and O
the O
human O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
. O
The O
issue O
flared O
in O
in O
March O
when O
government O
scientists O
admitted O
that O
people O
could O
become O
infected O
with O
Creutzfeldt-Jakob B-band
Disease I-band
( O
CJD O
) O
from O
eating O
BSE-infected O

said O
on O
Thursday O
the O

remained O
confident O
about O
the O

despite O
pressure O
from O

In O
an O

following O
its O

results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O

it O

taken O

Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
' O
s O
been O
in O
the O
first O
half O
. O
" O
" O
It O
' O
s O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O

( O

) O
this O
year O
. O
It O
could O
be O
better O
, O
or O
it O
could O
be O
worse O

" O
Hope O
added O
, O
echoing O
the O
demand O

across O

" O
You O
can O

however O
, O

looking O
a O
little O
better O

" O
he O
said O

with O
the O
end O
of O

, O
when O
T&N B-other
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 O
, O
Hope O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
' O
re O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O
Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope O
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O
" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African B-movie
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O
" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O
" O
We O
' O
ve O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O

that O
' O

quite O
capable O
of O
working O

difficult O

we O

Hope O
said O

" O
When O
the O
( O

" O
Fear O
that O
a O

spell O

the O

more O
important O
than O
whether O

continues O
at O

. O
" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O

, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O

adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. O

to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O

. O
Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-person
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O
If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O

would O
need O

" O

all O
